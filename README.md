<h1>freeCodeCamp | JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</h1>

<p>This repository contains my project completed as part of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sukis/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</a> from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Search App Project</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This project involves building an app that will search for Pokémon by name or ID and display the results to the user. To retrieve the Pokémon data and images, the app uses freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>This project was completed following specific instructions provided by freeCodeCamp. The requirements included creating an input element for the search, a button to trigger the search, and display elements for the Pokémon's name, ID, weight, height, types, and stats. The app ensures that valid Pokémon data is retrieved and displayed, and handles cases where the Pokémon is not found.</p>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<p>In addition to this project, I have also completed the following projects as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roman Numeral Converter</li>
  <li>Telephone Number Validator</li>
  <li>Cash Register</li>
  <li>Palindrome Checker</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project demonstrates various aspects of JavaScript and Data Structures and was completed according to the guidelines provided by freeCodeCamp.</p>
